# Credit_Card_fraud_Detection_dataset_solution
Credit Card fraud detection is a dataset in Kaggle. Here is my solution for this problem. 
I have used both undersampling and oversampling techniques to find the best solution. 
The resampled data has been tested on 6 models namely:
Logistic Regrression, K Neighbor Classifier, Decision Treee classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random FOrest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier.
Tomek and SMOTE is used for undersampling and oversasmpling respectively. 
Conclusion: On both the forms of resampled data Random Forest Classifier performed the best for this dataset.
